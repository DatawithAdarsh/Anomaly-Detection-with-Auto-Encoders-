# Anomaly Detection with Auto-Encoders (

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect anomalies in credit card transactions using auto-encoders. The focus is on learning representations of non-fraudulent transactions to distinguish them from fraudulent ones.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed the credit card fraud dataset to understand its characteristics and distribution.
- **Visualization:** Visualized clusters in the dataset using a t-SNE plot to gain insights into the data.
- **Auto-Encoder Implementation:** Implemented an auto-encoder model to learn representations of non-fraudulent transactions.
- **Ensemble Voting Classifier:** Achieved 98.7% accuracy using an ensemble voting classifier with KNN, SVC, DTs, GaussianNB, RF, XGBoost, and LightGBM

## Results
The auto-encoder model learned effective representations of non-fraudulent transactions, enabling accurate detection of anomalies with the ensemble voting classifier.

## Future Improvements
- Explore other anomaly detection techniques.
- Enhance visualization techniques for better insights.
- Experiment with different ensemble configurations for improved accuracy.
